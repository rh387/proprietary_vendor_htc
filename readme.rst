**About "get_binary.sh"**

- A *certain* binary has been removed from this git due to DMCA takedowns going into effect, to make up for this I have wrote this get_binary.sh
- It downloads a .zip containing the binary from a mirror, then extracts the binary into the 3 HTC device proprietary file directories


**How to**

- Add to manifest or git clone into vendor dir
- cd into vendor dir , then run get_binary.sh. This will obtain binary needed from a overseas host.
